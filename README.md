  # Apollo-Server-Express-Template (MongoDB & Express)

  *Note that: <strong>apollo-server is not compatible with apollo-server-express</strong>

  Feature 1: <br>
  MongoDB connected, so that data are saved to and re-called from the cloud database(alais "DB") server <br>
  Feature 2: <br>
  Express oriented - which means use <strong>express npm package</strong> plus <strong>apollo-server-express</strong> (additional freedom in self defining some connection configuration) <br>
