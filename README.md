  ### Installation

  As for Backend <br>

  All necessary code are in a single file: "Backend" Folder "index.js" file [Go to index.js](https://github.com/Hongnodie/Apollo-Server-Client-Template/tree/React-MongoDB-Express/Backend/index.js)

  All commands to run for backend (in the terminal) (or alias "Shell") are summed up here
  ```
  npm install graphql mongoose express apollo-server-express
  node index.js
  ```

  As for Frontend <br>

  All necessary code displayed in two forms: built-in index or export default to index.js [Go to frontend folder](https://github.com/Hongnodie/Apollo-Server-Client-Template/tree/React-MongoDB-Express/Frontend/reactscript)

  All commands to run for frontend (in the terminal) (or alias "Shell") are summed up here (terminal direct to the index.js in frontend folder i.e. /Frontend/reactscript/src)
  ```
  npm install react react-dom react-router-dom @apollo/client react-scripts 
  npm start
  ```

  (This should take around a minute to start and automatically open the browser on my desktop)
